   * actual error will be re-thrown, i.e. the returned promise will be rejected with it. If no error occur, the returned
   * promise resolves to the response body.
   *

   * 80% of requests where you don't need to do anything fancy.
   *
   * @param response$ Observable as received from any request made with the default HttpClient.
   * @param errorMessage Message to prepend the logged error.
   *
   * @return A promise resolving to the response body on success or rejecting to the error.
